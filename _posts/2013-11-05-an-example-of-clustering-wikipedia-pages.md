Recently, I wrote a couple of tools to download and arrange  web pages. Even
though they were intended only for getting a sample of text documents for
some research, it looks awesome.  I wrote a simple demo that downloaded a
bunch of webpages similar with initial one from Wikipedia, arranged them in
hierachy of clusters and dumped a page to navigate these clusters.  You can
look at outcome of [clustering pages for word "Algorithm"](/demo/treeapproximator/algorithm.html), 
or read a short description
[there](/demo/treeapproximator/2013-11-04-an-outcome-of-hierarchical-clustering-of-wikipedia-pages.html).
