Recently, I wrote [a couple of tools to download and arrange web pages](https://github.com/electricmind/webcrawler). Even though they were intended only for getting a text corpora for some research, it looks awesome. I wrote a simple demo that took a bunch of webpages similar with initial one from Wikipedia, arranged them in hierachy of clusters and dumped a page to navigate these clusters. You can look at [the bunch of pages referred from an article  about "Algorithm" grouped by similarity](/demo/treeapproximator/algorithm.html), or read a short description [here](/demo/treeapproximator/2013-11-04-an-outcome-of-hierarchical-clustering-of-wikipedia-pages.html).
