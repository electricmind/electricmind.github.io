An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of a sensible phrase, like "GNU" for "Gnu Not Unux".
I always wondered how they did this, until I realised possible way. I implemented the [Acronym's generator](http://enwiz.jelasticloud.com/#acronym) and easily got a few acronyms:

 - S.E.C.O.N.D.L.I.F.E. : *"Something Else Came Out Next Day Like If For Everyone ."*,
 - A.N.I.M.O.S.I.T.Y.	: *"And Not In Me Or Something In Them Yet ."*,
 - A.R.T.I.F.I.C.I.A.L. : *"And Remember That I Felt It Coming In And Looked ."*,
 - G.R.I.M.M.		: *"Go Right In My Mind ."*,
 - M.I.N.D. 		: *"Mind Is Not Disappointed ."*,
 - G.O.N.E. 		: *"Glock Or No Effect ."*,
 - C.O.N.T.R.O.L.	: *"Crazy Or Not The Right Or Left ."*,
 - A.C.T.I.V.I.T.Y. 	: *"Any Company That Is Very Important To You ."*,
 - P.Y.T.H.O.N. 	: *"Put Your Tongue Hanging Out Near ."*,
 - J.A.V.A. 		: *"Jack And Vinnie Arriving ."*,
 - S.C.A.L.A.		: *"She Could Actually Look At ."*,
 - F.O.R.T.R.A.N.	: *"For One Reason The Road And Now ."*,
 - P.H.P.		: *"Perhaps He Pulled ."*,
 - H.T.M.L. 		: *"He Took My Left .",*
 - H.H.H.H.H.H.H. 	: *"He Had His Hand He Held Her ."*,
 - I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I. 	: *"I Imagined It If It Is In It ."*,
 - S.S.S.S.S.S.S. 	: *"She Said She Should Say Something Short ."*.

These phrases was generated by an algorithm for the given words, which doesn't pretend to make them sensible or even grammatically correct, it only finds probable ones. You can try your own words with the [demo](http://enwiz.jelasticloud.com/#acronym).

The algorithm is simple: since conditional probabilities allow to estimate probabilities of existance of different phrases, then an algorithm can explore the set of all possible phrases that form given acronym, looking for the one with maximum probability. Its implementation are included into [EnWiz toy](https://github.com/electricmind/enwiz).
